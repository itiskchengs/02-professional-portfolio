# 02-professional-portfolio

In this project I created my portfolio page from scratch. I created a navigation, hero section, about section, work section and a contact section. The whole web page is responsive on all screensizes and devices.

- Created the skeleton of the portfolio page in the HTML file.  
    - Utilized semantic HTML elements so its easier to decypher where each section is. 
    - Added classes and ids to the semantic elements and divs.

- I used flexbox for the whole layout and all the responsiveness. 

- I used media queries in combination with flexbox to ensure that it was responsive for tablet and mobile devices.

- I added all the alt tags to the images in the HTMl file.

- I added anchor links to the navigation so it takes you to each specific part on the page. 

- Each image when hovered over and focused on zooms in and englarges the image.

- Set up colors using root so its easier to target when working with it in CSS
